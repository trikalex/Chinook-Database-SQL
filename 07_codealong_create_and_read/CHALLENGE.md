# 07 - CodeAlong: Create and Read

---

### Your Challenge
 - Create a new record for yourself on the Programmer table.

### Reminders
- Remember to comment-out your previous session(s) to avoid duplicates.
- The key of `famous_for` can be anything you'd like to celebrate about yourself.
- Once added, your record should have the primary_key of `7`, if following along.
- Don't panicif your primary_key isn't `7`, just make note of the actual PK for later.
